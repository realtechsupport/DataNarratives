This course combines story telling  with computational media and data practices. 

We will use computer code developed on cloud platforms to organize, annotate and display data sets collected from different domains (social media, environmental studies)  and learn about fundamental concepts behind time series datasets together and basis statistical principles, and reflect on the opportunities and limitations of what such information can reliably tell us. We will explore various visualization approaches and techniques to transfer what we understand in and from the data into compelling and refined visual artifacts.

This course is designed primarily for artists, architects and designers who want to learn how to carefully integrate data visualization into their creative practices and can equally well serve other students interested in expanding their data handling and visualization skills.
