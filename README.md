This course is designed for artists and designers who want to learn how to integrate data visualization into their creative practice.

This course combines story telling with data practices. In order to achieve this goal, the course will combine the old craft of identifying and researching an event worthy of attention together with new craft of data visualization, with lots of attention on  information manipulation across all media forms.  

We will use computer code developed on cloud platforms to organize, annotate and display data as a key element in the making of a narrative event. Importantly, we will not limit the creation methods to computational media, rather we will seek to combine traditional drawing and sketching approaches into computer produced output as hybrid visual products.

Students will learn the basics of information capture through data and the use of graphical elements to display numerical relationships.
